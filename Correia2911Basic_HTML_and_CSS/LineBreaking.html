        <p>Lemurs are primates found exclusively in the isolated island of Madagascar. Lemurs are primates just like apes and monkeys, but they evolved independently and are unique. The numbers of lemurs are dwindling due to poaching and other destructive human activities. Lemurs are worth more than $2 Trillion. In fact, no amount of money can ever buy one. So, protect lemurs! <span>     </span></p>
